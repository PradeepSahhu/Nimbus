# Nimbus - Self-Hosted File Backup Server

## Project Overview
Nimbus is a **self-hosted local file backup server** designed for **personal use, small teams, and developers** who want an easy, reliable, and locally managed backup solution. Users can upload files via a web interface, and the system tracks them in a database while ensuring the actual file storage remains persistent on disk.

### Key Features (MVP)
- **File Upload & Management**: Upload, view, and manage files from a modern web UI.
- **Local Storage Support**: Files are stored locally on the host machine or an attached volume.
- **User Authentication**: Secure login system with roles (admin/user).
<!-- - **Scheduled Backups**: Users can configure automated backups. -->
- **Activity Logs**: Tracks uploads, deletions, and system events for easy debugging.
- **Dockerized Deployment**: Runs in isolated containers for easy setup and portability.
